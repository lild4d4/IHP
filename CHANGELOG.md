## [2.0.0](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2026-07-04

### Removed

- `ihp.cells2` — CNI-based PyCell reference implementations removed. Use `ihp.cells` pure-Python parametric cells.
- `ihp.cells_fixed` — deprecated fixed-GDS wrapper cells removed. Equivalent parametric cells exist in `ihp.cells`.
- `cni` — CNI runtime package removed (was only required by `cells2`).
- `test_xor_transistors.py` — XOR regression tests against `cells2` removed.
- `CuPillarPad_fixed` renamed to `CuPillarPad` and moved to `ihp.cells.bondpads`.

### Changed

- `add_pads_top` default pad changed from `CuPillarPad_fixed` to `CuPillarPad`.


## [0.3.0](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2026-06-26

No significant changes.


## [0.2.8](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/releases/tag/v0.2.8) - 2026-04-19


### Added

- SAX frequency-domain models for resistors (rsil, rppd, rhigh), capacitors (cmim, rfcmim, cmom), and inductors (inductor2, inductor3). [#105](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/issues/105)

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2026-02-15

### Deprecated

- Fixed-GDS cells (`*_fixed`) are now deprecated in favour of the equivalent pure-Python parametric cells. They remain available but will be removed in a future release.

### Added

- Pure GDSFactory RF-MOSFETs (`nfet_rf`, `pfet_rf`) with full layout generation, split from the transistors module [#90](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/90)
- `TechIHP` Pydantic model centralizing all FET + RF geometry design-rule constants [#90](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/90)
- `cells2` PyCell reference page in documentation, documenting the CNI-ported reference implementations
- Technology page (`docs/tech.rst`) documenting `ihp.tech`: layer map, layer stack, design rules, cross-sections, and routing strategies
- 5 GHz up-converter mixer demo (`mixer5ghz`) added to documentation
- Palace EM simulation notebooks added to docs [#80](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/80)
- Scheme-to-YAML tools and source netlist converter [#87](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/87)
- SPICE-to-YAML converter module with examples [#84](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/84)
- 160 GHz LNA design example [#71](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/71)
- Port overlap test [#94](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/94)
- `make docs-clean` and `make docs-serve` targets for local doc previewing

### Changed

- Documentation restructured: "PDK Reference" section with separate pages for parametric cells, deprecated fixed cells, and cells2 reference
- Documentation generation script now produces three RST pages instead of one

### Fixed

- Port layers now use pin sublayers with `port_type="electrical"` across all cells [#94](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/94)
- Double `_fixed_fixed` naming bug on `cmim_fixed` and `inductor2_fixed`
- MOSFET layout improved and fuzzed against PyCell reference [#88](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ihp/pull/88)
- `import_gds` (`functools.partial`) no longer leaks into the cell catalog documentation

### Removed

- Obsolete `bipolar.py` and `transistors.py` shims
